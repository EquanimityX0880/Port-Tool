> What is this?
A simple python script to interface with your router and open new ports.

> How do I use it?
Edit 'ports.txt'. Enter a port number, press enter. Each port number should be on its own line.

> Why would I use this?
My router "forgets" its port configuration when it powers off. It powers off more often than I'd like. This script turns a process into a simple mouse click.
