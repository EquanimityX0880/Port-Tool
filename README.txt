> What is this?
A simple python script to interface with your router and open new ports.

> How do I use it?
Download the release OR download "port tool.py." Make sure "ports.txt" can be found in the same directory path as this script.
Edit 'ports.txt'. For each port you want to open, enter that port number on its own line.

> Why would I use this?
My router "forgets" its port configuration when it powers off. This script turns a process into a simple mouse click.
